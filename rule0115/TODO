Global:
Macros aliases without args (__pfn_to_phys)?
+EXtract EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL separately

Better dynamic blacklist support - exclude only from definitions file

Remove workarounds after bugfixes in generate.sh
Remove might_sleep comment in model.common.in && remove generation of aspects on macros and static inline funxtions

interrupt
local_irq_disable
spin_lock
rcu_lock

irqhandler_t - proper aspect generation
