Global:
Rewrite all in perl with caching and multithreading
Macros aliases without args (__pfn_to_phys)?
EXtract EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL separately

Better dynamic blacklist support - exclude only from definitions file

Check static inline extraction terminator - ')' or '{' and not ';'.

Remove workarounds after bugfixes in generate.sh
Remove might_sleep comment in model.common.in

Rewrite cscope index generation procedure - standard is not enought
